# What Would Paul Graham Do?

I am currently reading Paul Graham's essay "How to do great work," and I find his essay quite prescient. While reading, I thought to myself, "This article has a lot of mental models. It'd be great if I could ask a bot questions and it'd provide me answers (quotes) that are gotten from these essays."
I understand that this is a very narrow-minded view, and I agree. Nonetheless, it presents an interesting opportunity for me to put some of my ML learnings into practice.

## The Goal

The goal is simple: to build a chatbot trained on the essays of Paul Graham such that it can answer questions asked of it by pointing you to a quote in his essays

## Technologies

- LLM (foundational model)
- RAG (Retrievable Augmented Generation)
- Vector database?

Come along for the ride!
